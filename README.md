# Sprockets::Derailleur

Speed up Manifest::Compile by forking processes

## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile: `gem 'sprockets-derailleur'`
2. And then execute: `$ bundle`, or install it yourself as: `$ gem install sprockets-derailleur`
3. Require `sprockets-derailleur` in environment file: `require 'sprockets-derailleur'`

## Usage

To override the number of processes you can use the `worker_count` configuration
setting or the `SPROCKETS_DERAILLEUR_WORKER_COUNT` environment variable.
It defaults to the number of processors on your machine.

### Configuration

You are able to configure Sprockets::Derailleur by creating a configure block (an example can be seen below).
This is entirely optional and will by default use the settings commented out in the example below.
If you would like to configure Sprockets::Derailleur, putting this configuration in an initializer is a good idea.

```ruby
# file: config/initializers/sprockets-derailleur.rb

SprocketsDerailleur.configure do |config|
  # Override how long the file lock timeout lasts
  # config.file_lock_timeout = 10

  # Set to true to log the compiled time lines to the warn level
  # (usually they are logged to the debug level)
  #config.warn_compile_times = false

  # Override the number of workers to use
  # If not set will use SPROCKETS_DERAILLEUR_WORKER_COUNT environment variable
  # and if that's also not set, then will use the number of processors
  # config.worker_count = 8

  # Has the same effect as setting the rails cache file store to be the new
  # thread safe sprockets derailleur one, but monkey patches methods instead of
  # instantiating new object.
  # config.use_sprockets_derailleur_file_store = false
end
```

### Rails 4.0

Just drop in the Gemfile, nothing more.

### Rails 3.2

To install to an existing rails 3.2 project, first create a new file, 'sprockets_derailleur.rb' in config/initializers.

Here we need to override some core parts of the sprockets module.

```ruby
module Sprockets
  class StaticCompiler

    alias_method :compile_without_manifest, :compile
    def compile
      puts "Multithreading on " + SprocketsDerailleur.worker_count.to_s + " processors"
      puts "Starting Asset Compile: " + Time.now.getutc.to_s

      # Then initialize the manifest with the workers you just determined
      manifest = Sprockets::Manifest.new(env, target)
      manifest.compile paths

      puts "Finished Asset Compile: " + Time.now.getutc.to_s

    end
  end

  class Railtie < ::Rails::Railtie
    config.after_initialize do |app|

      config = app.config
      next unless config.assets.enabled

      if config.assets.manifest
        path = File.join(config.assets.manifest, "manifest.json")
      else
        path = File.join(Rails.public_path, config.assets.prefix, "manifest.json")
      end

      if File.exist?(path)
        manifest = Sprockets::Manifest.new(app, path)
        config.assets.digests = manifest.assets
      end

    end
  end

end
```

The first block that overrides compile method starts sprockets derailleur with the chosen number of worker threads.
For maximum performance this should be the same number of processor cores on your compile machine.

The second block that is called after rails initializes is there because newer versions of sprockets are writing your
digested assets to manifest.json (Rails 4), instead of manifest.yml (Rails 3.2).

We therefore load in manifest.json using the Rails 4 method, as your asset compile will write this file. To avoid a duplicate
load, remember to delete the old manifest.yml from your public/assets folder.

A word of caution however, some gems that work with the asset pipeline still expect manifest.yml to exist.

Sprockets derailleur is known to work with (and possibly others):

- turbo-sprockets-rails3
- asset-sync

If you only intent to use digest assets, for example in production environments, you can also speed up your compile by using

```
rake assets:precompile:primary RAILS_ENV=production
```

This skips the non-digest compile, hence doubling speed (especially useful if syncing assets with a remote server).

## Troubleshooting

In some situations (like if you are using compass sprites) you may see
occasional exceptions such as:

```
lib/active_support/core_ext/marshal.rb:6:in `load': end of file reached (EOFError)

AND/OR

lib/sprockets-derailleur/manifest.rb:127:in `write': Broken pipe (Errno::EPIPE)
```

The default cache is not safe for parallel, you can override it by adding the
following to `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
config.assets.configure do |env|
  env.cache = SprocketsDerailleur::FileStore.new("tmp/cache/assets")
end
```
